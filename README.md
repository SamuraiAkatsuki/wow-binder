World of Warcraft keybinding addon for each race/class/spec

Features:
- Unlimited length macros
- Similar (almost identical) positions of abilities for each race/class/spec
- Use of regular action buttons (1-6) with Alt, good for vehicle UIs.

Note:
- Current up-to-date with Cataclysm abilities.
- Small fixes for Balance Druid bring it up to Pandaria, but not completely.
- Small fixes for Frost Mage bring it up to WoD, but not completely.

Pull requests are welcome, please help bring it up to date with current
abilities.
